                <h5 class="text-capitalize">What is Fiscal Sponsorship?</h5>
                <p class="page">According to the Trust for Conservation Innovation, a fiscal sponsor is &quot;a nonprofit organization that provides 
                    fiduciary oversight, financial management, and other administrative services to help build the capacity of charitable projects.&quot;</p>
                <p class="page">Fiscal sponsorships are valuable for organizations that are not yet recognized as tax-exempt under IRS Code Section 501 (c)(3), 
                    have had their tax-exemption revoked or find that it makes sense for them to operate under the umbrella of another tax-exempt organization 
                    with a compatible mission.</p>

                <h5 class="text-capitalize">What are the benefits?</h5>
                <p class="page">The benefits are different for each fiscal sponsorship agreement â€“ based on the specific needs of the individual organization 
                    entering into the contract. Some basic benefits include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Donors are able to claim a tax deduction (for organizations which do not have tax-exempt status but are in a fiscal sponsorship 
                        relationship)</li>
                    <li>The non-tax-exempt organization can, under a fiscal sponsorship agreement, accept grants from private foundations</li>
                    <li>For emerging organizations, it can provide an opportunity to test its ideas to determine community need and/or value</li>
                    <li>Allows for some organizations/programs to achieve their mission without ever creating a new and separate entity</li>
                    <li>For some organizations, either tax-exempt or not, entering a fiscal sponsorship relationship makes sense because it allows 
                        them to outsource some or all back-office tasks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="text-capitalize">What services are available?</h5>
                <p class="page">The services are customized to the needs of each individual organization entering into a fiscal sponsorship agreement. 
                    Some of the possible services offered through such an agreement include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Receipt and administration of charitable contributions on behalf of the sponsored organization</li>
                    <li>Paying bills</li>
                    <li>Cash flow analysis</li>
                    <li>Inclusion in annual Audit/990</li>
                    <li>Capacity building</li>
