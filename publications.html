            <p class="page text-center"><strong>“A Case Study, Reentry to Workforce Partnership.”</strong></p>

            <blockquote>
                <p class="page">"Reentry is a complex issue that requires multiple stakeholders from different sectors to work and learn together. This case study discusses how to build a partnership willing to adapt and learn as well as how to create a structure to support alignment between partners. Through the collective learning process, the partners learned what people returning from prison need to be successful, and what they still need to learn to further improve Philadelphia's reentry system."</p>
