                <em>Summary:&nbsp;</em>This workshop explores strategies &amp; lessons learned for incorporating contextualized literacy skills into occupational training programs. Organizations that provide job training to lower-skilled adults through Jobs for the Future’s GreenWays initiative have found they can better prepare workers for employment by integrating contextualized literacy into their programs. The workshop highlights two case studies drawn from GreenWays programs in Philadelphia &amp; Detroit that integrate contextualized literacy skills into their training programs. Participants will learn about each program’s approach to providing contextualized literacy &amp; some of the successes &amp; lessons learned from each strategy.</p>
