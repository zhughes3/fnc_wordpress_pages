            <p class="text-justify">Collective Impact’s aim is to intervene and reorient the set of behaviors, interactions, projects and programs in an existing system in order to produce a different, enduring and large-scale result.</p>

            <p class="text-justify"><strong><em>Collective Impact</em></strong> is a more
                disciplined and higher performing approach for building cross-sector
                partnerships that leads to positive and consistent progress at scale
                against the issues we are most passionate about. Complex social
                problems, such as the health of returning citizens, and their
                solutions arise from the interaction of many organizations within a
                larger system. The ultimate goal is to sustain and scale long-term
                systemic change and impact in the community. </p>
            <p class="text-center"><em>“When human beings gather in groups, a depth of
                    awareness and insight, a transcendent knowing, becomes available to
                    us that, if accessed, can lead to profound action. We call this
                    transcendent knowing collective wisdom.</em><em> This knowing is not
                    of the mind alone, nor is it of any individual alone. When
                    knowing and sense of right action emerges, it does so from deep
                    within the individual participants, from within the collective
                    awareness of the group, and from within the larger field that
                    holds the group.”</em></p>
