We would not have been able to make such an impact on our surrounding communities without the help from our individual donors. Thanks to you, we have raised millions of dollars to help those individuals, families and communities who needed our help. Thanks to you, we continually inch forward towards our vision of living in a world where communities thrive.</p>
